## Divisive Word Lexicon
We define language as "divisive" if it intends to impugn and delegitimize the speaker's target, e.g., by attacking their intelligence, integrity, or intentions. Such labels are expressly designed to put the target on defense and accentuate differences and distance between parties.

The methodology of lexicon construction is described in our paper. In this repo, we provide two files:
- `majority-words.txt` - contains the 178 terms that â‰¥3 out of 4 annotators agree are divisive. This set is used for analysis in the paper.
- `unanimous-words.txt` - contains the 123 terms that all 4 annotators agree are divisive. 

## Methods & Analysis

### Uniqueness score

Model training: see [models/README.md](models/README.md)

Get scores from model: run `analysis/score_uniqueness.py`. See `analysis/run_score_uniqueness.sh` for an example of how to run this script.

Plot scores: run `analysis/plot_uniqueness.py`. See `analysis/run_plot_uniqueness.sh` for an example of how to run this script.

### Divisive lexicon usage
Run `analysis/plot_divisive_lexicon.py`. See `analysis/run_plot_lexicon.sh` for an example of how to run this script.


### FW-overlap analysis
Run `analysis/plot_fw_overlap.py`. See `analysis/run_fw_overlap.sh` for an example of how to run this script.
