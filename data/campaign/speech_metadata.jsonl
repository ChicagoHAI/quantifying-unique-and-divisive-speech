Below are the remarks as prepared for delivery.\n\"I particularly appreciate the introduction from my good friend and tireless campaign companion, Gov. Bob McDonnell.\u00a0 He is showing what conservative leadership can do to build a stronger economy.\u00a0 Thank you also Congressman Goodlatte for joining us today. And particular thanks to Gen. Peay. I appreciate your invitation to be with you today at the Virginia Military Institute.\u00a0 It is a great privilege to be here at an Institution that has done so much for our nation, both in war and in peace.\nFor more than 170 years, VMI has done more than educate students.\u00a0 It has guided their transformation into citizens, and warriors, and leaders.\u00a0 VMI graduates have served with honor in our nation's defense, just as many are doing today in Afghanistan and other lands.\u00a0 Since the September 11th attacks, many of VMI's sons and daughters have defended America, and I mourn with you the 15 brave souls who have been lost. I join you in praying for the many VMI graduates and all Americans who are now serving in harm's way.\u00a0 May God bless all who serve, and all who have served.\nOf all the VMI graduates, none is more distinguished than George Marshall\u2014the Chief of Staff of the Army who became Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense, who helped to vanquish fascism and then planned Europe's rescue from despair. His commitment to peace was born of his direct knowledge of the awful costs and consequences of war.\nGeneral Marshall once said, \"The only way human beings can win a war is to prevent it.\"\u00a0 Those words were true in his time\u2014and they still echo in ours.\nLast month, our nation was attacked again.\u00a0 A U.S. Ambassador and three of our fellow Americans are dead\u2014murdered in Benghazi, Libya.\u00a0 Among the dead were three veterans.\u00a0 All of them were fine men, on a mission of peace and friendship to a nation that dearly longs for both.\u00a0 President Obama has said that Ambassador Chris Stevens and his colleagues represented the best of America.\u00a0 And he is right.\u00a0 We all mourn their loss.\nThe attacks against us in Libya were not an isolated incident.\u00a0 They were accompanied by anti-American riots in nearly two dozen other countries, mostly in the Middle East, but also in Africa and Asia.\u00a0 Our embassies have been attacked.\u00a0 Our flag has been burned.\u00a0 Many of our citizens have been threatened and driven from their overseas homes by vicious mobs, shouting \"Death to America.\" These mobs hoisted the black banner of Islamic extremism over American embassies on the anniversary of the September 11th attacks.\nAs the dust settles, as the murdered are buried, Americans are asking how this happened, how the threats we face have grown so much worse, and what this calls on America to do.\u00a0 These are the right questions.\u00a0 And I have come here today to offer a larger perspective on these tragic recent events\u2014and to share with you, and all Americans, my vision for a freer, more prosperous, and more peaceful world.\u00a0\nThe attacks on America last month should not be seen as random acts.\u00a0 They are expressions of a larger struggle that is playing out across the broader Middle East\u2014a region that is now in the midst of the most profound upheaval in a century.\u00a0 And the fault lines of this struggle can be seen clearly in Benghazi itself.\nThe attack on our Consulate in Benghazi on September 11th, 2012 was likely the work of forces affiliated with those that attacked our homeland on September 11th, 2001. This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam, despite the Administration's attempts to convince us of that for so long.\u00a0 No, as the Administration has finally conceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on others, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to wage perpetual war on the West.\u00a0\nWe saw all of this in Benghazi last month\u2014but we also saw something else, something hopeful.\u00a0 After the attack on our Consulate, tens of thousands of Libyans, most of them young people, held a massive protest in Benghazi against the very extremists who murdered our people.\u00a0 They waved signs that read, \"The Ambassador was Libya's friend\" and \"Libya is sorry.\" They chanted \"No to militias.\"\u00a0 They marched, unarmed, to the terrorist compound.\u00a0 Then they burned it to the ground.\u00a0 As one Libyan woman said, \"We are not going to go from darkness to darkness.\"\nThis is the struggle that is now shaking the entire Middle East to its foundation.\u00a0 It is the struggle of millions and millions of people\u2014men and women, young and old, Muslims, Christians and non-believers\u2014all of whom have had enough of the darkness.\u00a0 It is a struggle for the dignity that comes with freedom, and opportunity, and the right to live under laws of our own making.\u00a0 It is a struggle that has unfolded under green banners in the streets of Iran, in the public squares of Tunisia and Egypt and Yemen, and in the fights for liberty in Iraq, and Afghanistan, and Libya, and now Syria.\u00a0 In short, it is a struggle between liberty and tyranny, justice and oppression, hope and despair.\nWe have seen this struggle before.\u00a0 It would be familiar to George Marshall.\u00a0 In his time, in the ashes of world war, another critical part of the world was torn between democracy and despotism.\u00a0 Fortunately, we had leaders of courage and vision, both Republicans and Democrats, who knew that America had to support friends who shared our values, and prevent today's crises from becoming tomorrow's conflicts.\nStatesmen like Marshall rallied our nation to rise to its responsibilities as the leader of the free world.\u00a0 We helped our friends to build and sustain free societies and free markets.\u00a0 We defended our friends, and ourselves, from our common enemies.\u00a0 We led.\u00a0 And though the path was long and uncertain, the thought of war in Europe is as inconceivable today as it seemed inevitable in the last century.\nThis is what makes America exceptional:\u00a0 It is not just the character of our country\u2014it is the record of our accomplishments.\u00a0 America has a proud history of strong, confident, principled global leadership\u2014a history that has been written by patriots of both parties.\u00a0 That is America at its best.\u00a0 And it is the standard by which we measure every President, as well as anyone who wishes to be President. Unfortunately, this President's policies have not been equal to our best examples of world leadership.\u00a0 And nowhere is this more evident than in the Middle East.\u00a0\nI want to be very clear:\u00a0 The blame for the murder of our people in Libya, and the attacks on our embassies in so many other countries, lies solely with those who carried them out\u2014no one else.\u00a0 But it is the responsibility of our President to use America's great power to shape history\u2014not to lead from behind, leaving our destiny at the mercy of events.\u00a0 Unfortunately, that is exactly where we find ourselves in the Middle East under President Obama.\nThe relationship between the President of the United States and the Prime Minister of Israel, our closest ally in the region, has suffered great strains. The President explicitly stated that his goal was to put \"daylight\" between the United States and Israel.\u00a0 And he has succeeded.\u00a0 This is a dangerous situation that has set back the hope of peace in the Middle East and emboldened our mutual adversaries, especially Iran.\nIran today has never been closer to a nuclear weapons capability.\u00a0 It has never posed a greater danger to our friends, our allies, and to us.\u00a0 And it has never acted less deterred by America, as was made clear last year when Iranian agents plotted to assassinate the Saudi Ambassador in our nation's capital.\u00a0 And yet, when millions of Iranians took to the streets in June of 2009, when they demanded freedom from a cruel regime that threatens the world, when they cried out, \"Are you with us, or are you with them?\"\u2014the American President was silent.\nAcross the greater Middle East, as the joy born from the downfall of dictators has given way to the painstaking work of building capable security forces, and growing economies, and developing democratic institutions, the President has failed to offer the tangible support that our partners want and need.\u00a0\nIn Iraq, the costly gains made by our troops are being eroded by rising violence, a resurgent Al-Qaeda, the weakening of democracy in Baghdad, and the rising influence of Iran. And yet, America's ability to influence events for the better in Iraq has been undermined by the abrupt withdrawal of our entire troop presence. The President tried\u2014and failed\u2014to secure a responsible and gradual drawdown that would have better secured our gains.\nThe President has failed to lead in Syria, where more than 30,000 men, women, and children have been massacred by the Assad regime over the past 20 months. Violent extremists are flowing into the fight.\u00a0 Our ally Turkey has been attacked.\u00a0 And the conflict threatens stability in the region.\nAmerica can take pride in the blows that our military and intelligence professionals have inflicted on Al-Qaeda in Pakistan and Afghanistan, including the killing of Osama bin Laden.\u00a0 These are real achievements won at a high cost.\u00a0 But Al-Qaeda remains a strong force in Yemen and Somalia, in Libya and other parts of North Africa, in Iraq, and now in Syria. And other extremists have gained ground across the region.\u00a0 Drones and the modern instruments of war are important tools in our fight, but they are no substitute for a national security strategy for the Middle East.\nThe President is fond of saying that \"The tide of war is receding.\" \u00a0And I want to believe him as much as anyone. \u00a0But when we look at the Middle East today\u2014with Iran closer than ever to nuclear weapons capability, with the conflict in Syria threating to destabilize the region, with\u00a0violent extremists on the march, and with an American Ambassador and three others dead likely at the hands of Al-Qaeda affiliates\u2014 it is clear that the risk of conflict in the region is higher now than when the President took office.\nI know the President hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I share this hope.\u00a0 But hope is not a strategy.\u00a0 We cannot support our friends and defeat our enemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being arbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one of partnership, but of passivity.\u00a0\nThe greater tragedy of it all is that we are missing an historic opportunity to win new friends who share our values in the Middle East\u2014friends who are fighting for their own futures against the very same violent extremists, and evil tyrants, and angry mobs who seek to harm us.\u00a0 Unfortunately, so many of these people who could be our friends feel that our President is indifferent to their quest for freedom and dignity. As one Syrian woman put it, \"We will not forget that you forgot about us.\"\nIt is time to change course in the Middle East.\u00a0 That course should be organized around these bedrock principles:\u00a0 America must have confidence in our cause, clarity in our purpose and resolve in our might. No friend of America will question our commitment to support them... no enemy that attacks America will question our resolve to defeat them... and no one anywhere, friend or foe, will doubt America's capability to back up our words.\nI will put the leaders of Iran on notice that the United States and our friends and allies will prevent them from acquiring nuclear weapons capability. I will not hesitate to impose new sanctions on Iran, and will tighten the sanctions we currently have. I will restore the permanent presence of aircraft carrier task forces in both the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf region\u2014and work with Israel to increase our military assistance and coordination.\u00a0 For the sake of peace, we must make clear to Iran through actions\u2014not just words\u2014that their nuclear pursuit will not be tolerated.\nI will reaffirm our historic ties to Israel and our abiding commitment to its security\u2014the world must never see any daylight between our two nations.\nI will deepen our critical cooperation with our partners in the Gulf.\nAnd I will roll back President Obama's deep and arbitrary cuts to our national defense that would devastate our military. I will make the critical defense investments that we need to remain secure.\u00a0 The decisions we make today will determine our ability to protect America tomorrow.\u00a0 The first purpose of a strong military is to prevent war.\nThe size of our Navy is at levels not seen since 1916. I will restore our Navy to the size needed to fulfill our missions by building 15 ships per year, including three submarines.\u00a0 I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats. And on this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. And I will call on our NATO allies to keep the greatest military alliance in history strong by honoring their commitment to each devote 2 percent of their GDP to security spending. Today, only 3 of the 28 NATO nations meet this benchmark.\nI will make further reforms to our foreign assistance to create incentives for good governance, free enterprise, and greater trade, in the Middle East and beyond. I will organize all assistance efforts in the greater Middle East under one official with responsibility and accountability to prioritize efforts and produce results.\u00a0 I will rally our friends and allies to match our generosity with theirs.\u00a0 And I will make it clear to the recipients of our aid that, in return for our material support, they must meet the responsibilities of every decent modern government\u2014to respect the rights of all of their citizens, including women and minorities... to ensure space for civil society, a free media, political parties, and an independent judiciary... and to abide by their international commitments to protect our diplomats and our property.\nI will champion free trade and restore it as a critical element of our strategy, both in the Middle East and across the world.\u00a0 The President has not signed one new free trade agreement in the past four years.\u00a0 I will reverse that failure.\u00a0 I will work with nations around the world that are committed to the principles of free enterprise, expanding existing relationships and establishing new ones.\nI will support friends across the Middle East who share our values, but need help defending them and their sovereignty against our common enemies.\nIn Libya, I will support the Libyan people's efforts to forge a lasting government that represents all of them, and I will vigorously pursue the terrorists who attacked our consulate in Benghazi and killed Americans.\u00a0\u00a0\nIn Egypt, I will use our influence\u2014including clear conditions on our aid\u2014to urge the new government to represent all Egyptians, to build democratic institutions, and to maintain its peace treaty with Israel. And we must persuade our friends and allies to place similar stipulations on their aid.\nIn Syria, I will work with our partners to identify and organize those members of the opposition who share our values and ensure they obtain the arms they need to defeat Assad's tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. Iran is sending arms to Assad because they know his downfall would be a strategic defeat for them.\u00a0 We should be working no less vigorously with our international partners to support the many Syrians who would deliver that defeat to Iran\u2014rather than sitting on the sidelines.\u00a0 It is essential that we develop influence with those forces in Syria that will one day lead a country that sits at the heart of the Middle East.\u00a0\nAnd in Afghanistan, I will pursue a real and successful transition to Afghan security forces by the end of 2014.\u00a0 President Obama would have you believe that anyone who disagrees with his decisions in Afghanistan is arguing for endless war. But the route to more war \u2014 and to potential attacks here at home \u2014 is a politically timed retreat that abandons the Afghan people to the same extremists who ravaged their country and used it to launch the attacks of 9/11.\u00a0 I will evaluate conditions on the ground and weigh the best advice of our military commanders. And I will affirm that my duty is not to my political prospects, but to the security of the nation.\nFinally, I will recommit America to the goal of a democratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.\u00a0 On this vital issue, the President has failed, and what should be a negotiation process has devolved into a series of heated disputes at the United Nations. In this old conflict, as in every challenge we face in the Middle East, only a new President will bring the chance to begin anew.\nThere is a longing for American leadership in the Middle East\u2014and it is not unique to that region.\u00a0 It is broadly felt by America's friends and allies in other parts of the world as well\u2014 in Europe, where Putin's Russia casts a long shadow over young democracies, and where our oldest allies have been told we are \"pivoting\" away from them ... in Asia and across the Pacific, where China's recent assertiveness is sending chills through the region ... and here in our own hemisphere, where our neighbors in Latin America want to resist the failed ideology of Hugo Chavez and the Castro brothers and deepen ties with the United States on trade, energy, and security.\u00a0 But in all of these places, just as in the Middle East, the question is asked:\u00a0 \"Where does America stand?\"\nI know many Americans are asking a different question: \"Why us?\"\u00a0 I know many Americans are asking whether our country today\u2014with our ailing economy, and our massive debt, and after 11 years at war\u2014is still capable of leading.\u00a0\nI believe that if America does not lead, others will\u2014others who do not share our interests and our values\u2014and the world will grow darker, for our friends and for us.\u00a0 America's security and the cause of freedom cannot afford four more years like the last four years.\u00a0 I am running for President because I believe the leader of the free world has a duty, to our citizens, and to our friends everywhere, to use America's great influence\u2014wisely, with solemnity and without false pride, but also firmly and actively\u2014to shape events in ways that secure our interests, further our values, prevent conflict, and make the world better\u2014not perfect, but better.\u00a0\nOur friends and allies across the globe do not want less American leadership.\u00a0 They want more\u2014more of our moral support, more of our security cooperation, more of our trade, and more of our assistance in building free societies and thriving economies.\u00a0 So many people across the world still look to America as the best hope of humankind.\u00a0 So many people still have faith in America.\u00a0 We must show them that we still have faith in ourselves\u2014that we have the will and the wisdom to revive our stagnant economy, to roll back our unsustainable debt, to reform our government, to reverse the catastrophic cuts now threatening our national defense, to renew the sources of our great power, and to lead the course of human events.\nSir Winston Churchill once said of George Marshall:\u00a0 \"He ... always fought victoriously against defeatism, discouragement, and disillusion.\"\u00a0 That is the role our friends want America to play again.\u00a0 And it is the role we must play.\u00a0\nThe 21st century can and must be an American century. It began with terror, war, and economic calamity. It is our duty to steer it onto the path of freedom, peace, and prosperity.\u00a0\nThe torch America carries is one of decency and hope. It is not America's torch alone. But it is America's duty \u2014 and honor \u2014 to hold it high enough that all the world can see its light.\nThank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States of America.\n", "citation": "Mitt Romney, Remarks on Foreign Policy at the Virginia Military Institute in Lexington, Virginia: \"The Mantle of Leadership\" Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Interview conducted in Plains, Georgia.\nAPP Note: The following text was included before the transcript of the interview: \"To understand Jimmy Carter one has to come to Plains, Georgia. The Democratic candidate has his roots in this small and peaceful farming village of the South. All along the main street one sees the names of the Carter family: the Carter Docks, the Carter Antiques Store, the Carter Agricultural Company, even without taking into account the Carter election headquarters, installed at the station. Here one breathes the air of the traditionally virtuous America, forgotten a long time ago elsewhere. Carter is proud of Plains, and Plains is proud of Carter, though its 636 citizens are not yet completely aware of what is happening. For them, Jimmy has always been their rich neighbor, a prosperous peanut farmer. They find it difficult to imagine that one day he could become President of the United States. The Democratic candidate received the special reporter dispatched by L'Express and Free Radio-Television in a modest red brick house a mile from town and gave his first interview to a foreign newspaper and radio station.\"\n", "citation": "Jimmy Carter, Interview with Pierre Salinger for L'Express of Paris and Free Radio-Television Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.

Jones, D. Arkansas, was Chair of the Democratic National Committee.\u00a0\nAt 8:20 pm on November 5, Senator Jones notified Bryan that he (Jones) had conceded the election to McKinley.\u00a0 Jones also released the following statement:\nThe result of the Presidential election is apparently no longer in doubt. It has been one of the closest contests that the people have been called on to determine in recent years. We have claimed the election on our advices from States that were admittedly in doubt, in which we knew there had been many frauds, and from which there were evidences of tampering with the returns. It seems now to be apparent that while Mr. Bryan, after making the most brilliant campaign in the history of our country and having carried most of the States claimed to be doubtful, has not carried enough to assure his success in the Electoral College.\nBryan electors have been chosen from all of the States south of the Potomac and Ohio except West Virginia and all those west of the Missouri except California and Oregon. He has 190 electoral votes and this number may be increased by final returns from States yet in question. He has not obtained enough votes to carry the Electoral College. Thus this remarkable campaign closes with the election of William McKinley. The result was brought about by every kind of coercion and intimidation on the part of the money power, including threats of lockouts and dismissals and impending starvation; by the employment of by far the largest campaign fund ever used in this country, and by the subordination of a large portion of the American press.\nThe President-elect and his party are under the pledge to the American people to continue the gold standard, and by its operation to restore prosperity to this country. As Chief Executive Mr. McKinley will have the cordial support of the millions of patriotic Americans who have cast their votes for William Jennings Bryan. They bow to the majesty of office and bide by the result with none of the mutterings that would have come from the monied powers, had it been unsuccessful.\nThey are confident the gold standard cannot give the promised prosperity, but will gladly welcome it if it comes. They will continue the great struggle for the uplifting of humanity, and the maintenance of the dignity of our country in the establishment of the American monetary system. And the Democratic party aided by its present allies will still uplift the bimetallic standard and bear it on to victory.\u00a0\nSource:\u00a0 New York Times, \"Even Jones Gives It Up,\" November 6, 1896, p 5.\n", "citation": "William Jennings Bryan, Telegram to William McKinley Conceding the Presidential Election Online by Gerhard Peters and John T.
